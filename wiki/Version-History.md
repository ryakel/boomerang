## 2026-04-07

- fix(notifications): specific error messages for email config status [XS]
  - Startup log now says exactly what's missing (e.g. "missing: NOTIFICATION_EMAIL")
  - Settings UI distinguishes between "SMTP not configured" vs "No recipient email"
  - Modified: `emailNotifications.js`, `Settings.jsx`
- fix(packages): fix single-package refresh being blocked by downgrade guard [S]
  - Downgrade guard was blocking ALL status updates on user-initiated refresh, not just downgrades
  - Removed guard from single-package refresh (user explicitly wants fresh data)
  - Guard remains on automated polling loop and refresh-all (background protection)
  - Also: skip 5-min throttle for pending packages so user can retry immediately
  - Modified: `server.js`
- fix(packages): show refresh result feedback on individual package cards [S]
  - Card refresh button shows green checkmark when updated, "Up to date" when throttled
  - Detail modal refresh button shows same feedback
  - No more silent flash-and-grey with no visible change
  - Modified: `PackageCard.jsx`, `PackageDetailModal.jsx`
- fix(packages): prevent status downgrade from stale 17track responses [M]
  - 17track intermittently returns `NotFound` for packages that already have valid tracking data
  - Added status rank guard in all three poll paths (polling loop, refresh-all, single refresh)

- fix(packages): add offline localStorage cache for packages [S]
  - Packages now persist in `boom_packages_v1` localStorage key
  - Instant render from cache on app open, then server fetch overwrites
  - If server is down, cached packages still display instead of empty list
  - Modified: `src/hooks/usePackages.js`

  - Dockerfile stage 3 COPY line was missing the new file

- fix(packages): open tracking links in browser instead of PWA [XS]
  - PWAs intercept `target="_blank"` links within app scope
  - Use explicit `window.open()` to force external browser tab
  - Modified: `PackageCard.jsx`, `PackageDetailModal.jsx`
- fix(packages): update ALL duplicate packages, not just first match [S]
  - `batch.find()` only matched the first package with a given tracking number — duplicates never got updated
  - Changed to `batch.filter()` in both polling loop and refresh-all endpoint
  - Modified: `server.js`
- fix(packages): auto-refresh from 17track on app open [S]
  - Load cached data from DB first (instant render), then silently fire background refresh-all
  - SSE broadcast updates UI automatically when poll completes — no stale "Pending" cards
  - Modified: `src/hooks/usePackages.js`
- fix(packages): immediate poll on package create [S]
  - Package create now registers, waits 1.5s, polls 17track before responding
  - Card shows real status from the start instead of requiring manual refresh

  - Modified: `src/components/PackageCard.jsx`, `src/components/Packages.css`, `src/App.jsx`, `src/App.css`
- feat(packages): show duplicate badge on cards with same tracking number [XS]
  - Yellow "Duplicate" badge helps identify entries to clean up
  - Modified: `src/components/PackageCard.jsx`, `src/components/Packages.jsx`, `src/components/Packages.css`
- fix(packages): invalid date display + deduplicate registration calls [S]

- fix(packages): use 17track API v2.4 instead of v2.2 [XS]
  - API key was bound to v2.4 — v2.2 endpoints were returning empty results
  - Modified: `server.js`
- fix(packages): wrong request body format + status mapping for 17track v2.4 [M]
  - `gettrackinfo` was sending `{ number: [...] }` but v2.4 expects bare JSON array
  - Fixed status mapping to use `latest_status.status` object (not plain string)
  - Modified: `server.js`
- chore(config): add TRACKING_API_KEY to docker-compose and .env.example [XS]
  - Modified: `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `.env.example`
- fix(packages): add 17track registration step — tracking wasn't working [M]
  - 17track API requires numbers to be registered via `/register` before `gettrackinfo` returns data
  - New `register17track()` called on package create, manual refresh, and first poll cycle
  - Added response logging to diagnose API parsing issues
  - Modified: `server.js`
- fix(packages): tracking env key not seen by frontend — missing from getKeyStatus [XS]
  - `getKeyStatus()` was dropping the `tracking` field from the server response
  - Modified: `src/api.js`, `src/components/Settings.jsx`
- fix(packages): tracking API key not reaching server + add connect/test button [M]
  - `getApiHeaders()` was missing the `x-tracking-key` header — UI-provided key never sent to server
  - `getTrackingApiKey()` now falls back to DB-stored settings (not just env var + header)
  - Polling loop uses `getTrackingApiKey()` instead of only `envTrackingApiKey`
  - `keys/status` endpoint now checks DB-stored key too
  - New `POST /api/packages/test-connection` endpoint uses free quota check (no tracking query consumed)

  - Expandable via `expandedIntegration` state, status dot, credential toggle, env var detection
  - Modified: `src/components/Settings.jsx`

  - Modified: `src/components/Packages.jsx`, `src/components/Packages.css`, `server.js`
- feat(packages): add sort options — by status, delivery date, or carrier [S]
  - Sort dropdown in header (same pattern as task sort)
  - Status (default): groups by Issues/Active/Delivered with ETA sub-sort
  - Delivery date: flat list sorted by ETA, then status
  - Carrier: grouped by carrier name, status sub-sort within each group
  - Modified: `src/components/Packages.jsx`, `src/components/Packages.css`

### Notifications
- fix(notifications): fix broken notification system — wrong status filter + stale settings closure [M]
  - All notification types except high-priority were filtering `status === 'open'` (a legacy status that no longer exists) instead of `not_started`/`doing`/`waiting` — making overdue, stale, nudge, size-based, and pile-up notifications completely dead
  - Settings were captured once in the useEffect closure and never re-read — toggling notifications or changing frequencies required a task change (via SSE hydration) to take effect
  - Rewrote to use a single always-running 1-minute interval that reads settings fresh each tick, uses a ref for current tasks, and filters by actual active statuses
  - Modified: `src/hooks/useNotifications.js`

### Package Tracking
- feat(packages): add package tracking with 17track API integration [XL]
  - New `packages` table (migration 009) with full tracking lifecycle

  - Carrier auto-detection via regex patterns (USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL, Amazon, OnTrac, LaserShip)
  - Carrier website fallback links on every card (works without API key)
  - Status-colored cards: pending (gray), in_transit (blue), out_for_delivery (teal), delivered (green), exception (red)
  - Full tracking timeline in detail modal with event history
  - Signature-required detection with auto-creation of high-priority errand task (full nagging escalation)
  - Delivery/exception/out-for-delivery/signature notifications (respects quiet hours)
  - Configurable auto-cleanup of delivered packages (default: 3 days)
  - API quota exhaustion handling with in-app banner and automatic recovery at midnight UTC
  - Manual refresh with 5-minute per-package throttle
  - Package Tracking settings in Integrations tab (API key, retention, notification toggles)
  - Package icon in header bar between Analytics and Settings
  - SSE broadcast on package updates for cross-client sync
  - New files: `migrations/009_create_packages_table.sql`, `src/utils/carrierDetect.js`, `src/components/Packages.jsx`, `src/components/Packages.css`, `src/components/PackageCard.jsx`, `src/components/PackageDetailModal.jsx`, `src/hooks/usePackages.js`, `src/hooks/usePackageNotifications.js`

  - Modified: `CLAUDE.md`
- fix(gcal): push existing tasks to calendar on sync enable + new task create [M]
  - Initial sync picks up all tasks with due dates (today or future) when push sync is first enabled
  - New tasks with due dates now create calendar events immediately (was silently skipped)
  - 1-second stagger between initial sync events to avoid Google rate limits
  - Past due dates excluded from initial sync to avoid calendar clutter
  - Modified: `src/hooks/useExternalSync.js`
- fix(ui): hide Sync Now button unless pull sync is enabled [XS]
  - Button was confusing when user only wanted push sync
  - Modified: `src/components/Settings.jsx`

### Dev Tooling
- feat(server): add dev seed system for realistic test data [M]
