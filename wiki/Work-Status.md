# Work status and authorization

As of 2026-11-13; proposal based on dev `2c969266b848f5ac9e2bed4a830ca9f562baeece`
and issue [#1018](https://github.com/ryakel/boomerang/issues/1018). Refresh from
current code, user instructions and issue comments before continuing. This
snapshot complements the [decision log](Decision-Log.md), not a standing approval.

| Work | State | Authority / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture audit and evaluation design | Completed | [Investigation report](https://github.com/ryakel/boomerang/issues/1018#issuecomment-6842489957). Findings distinguish implementation from plans. |
| P1 synthetic fixtures, isolation and reproducibility | Completed and merged into dev | [Approval](https://github.com/ryakel/boomerang/issues/1018#issuecomment-6842559084), [PR #1019](https://github.com/ryakel/boomerang/pull/1019), [test evidence](https://github.com/ryakel/boomerang/issues/1018#issuecomment-6842854543). No runtime files/seams changed. |
| P1 merge's staging deployment | Previously approved for this merge only; workflow succeeded | [Recorded approval/merge](https://github.com/ryakel/boomerang/issues/1018#issuecomment-6843294678), [run 43361763071](https://github.com/ryakel/boomerang/actions/runs/43361763071). Production main unchanged. |
| Workspace product/decision documentation | Accepted and merged | [PR #1020](https://github.com/ryakel/boomerang/pull/1020); documentation-only, no deployment triggered. |
| Additional isolated tests/reproduction | Within P1's authorized boundary if needed | Current 19 cases cover the requested baseline; do not invent more work merely to “resume” a completed phase. Record a concrete gap before extending tests. |
| Recovery product behavior | Accepted direction/defaults | [Stop choices](https://github.com/ryakel/boomerang/issues/1018#issuecomment-6853223055), [capture/Undo/uncertainty defaults](https://github.com/ryakel/boomerang/issues/1018#issuecomment-6856481691). Acceptance is not runtime implementation authority. |
| Execution reliability implementation proposal | Prepared at owner's request; implementation not authorized | [E1–E5 proposal](Execution-Reliability-Proposal.md). Recommend E1 only as the first approval: durable execution records, duplicate protection and honest uncertain outcomes. |
| P2–P5 / agent extraction, new provider adapter, paid benchmark, rollout | Not authorized | P1 review limits; preserve current Claude defaults. Existing utility OpenAI support is not authorization to switch models or migrate Quokka. |

## Engineering evidence and limits

- P1: 19 characterization cases; adjacent suites: 131 tests. PR CI passed on
  Node 22; local P1 runs passed on Node 24. Green `REPRO` checks mean current
  risky behavior was reproduced, not repaired.
- Handoff recheck on merged dev: all 19 P1 cases passed again on Node 24.22.1;
  no tests or runtime code were changed in the documentation proposal.
- Reproduced: concurrent duplicate commit, uncertain external retry, stale
  staged writes/rollback, abort during commit, partial/failed compensation,
  irreversible delete, restart/session loss and event rollover. Sequential
  retry after a completed commit did not duplicate its event.
- Harness uses disposable synthetic DBs, fake integrations/notification sinks
  and verified network fences. It is component-level evidence, not a full
  browser/HTTP/model-loop or live-service evaluation. Disk checks follow an
  explicit flush; they do not establish crash-window durability.
- Existing docs can overstate behavior: Quokka notes describe “atomic” execution,
  while P1 proves partial external effects; Architecture.md includes legacy
  data-flow/test descriptions. Inspect actual tools, `commitPlan`,
  `useAdviser.js` and package scripts before making current technical claims.
- P1 audit recorded 31 existing dependency vulnerabilities, including two
  critical; dependencies/lockfile were unchanged. Counts are dated evidence,
  not a current audit or authorization to update dependencies.
- The handoff's fresh audit reports 32 (2 critical, 11 high, 16 moderate,
  3 low) against the same unchanged lockfile. Advisory counts can change
  independently of repository changes; no remediation is included here.

## Next action

Review the [bounded reliability proposal](Execution-Reliability-Proposal.md).
P1 is complete; no additional competitor research is needed. Audience, Stop
recovery choices and capture/Undo/uncertainty defaults are settled (D005–D007).
Exact history retention and supported inverse operations are proposed details.
E1 implementation, its schema/UI changes, merge and deployment require their
own authority. P2–P5 provider work remains unapproved.
