# Kept — the Boomerang design language

> **Status (2026-06-10): approved direction, pre-implementation.** Chosen from a
> three-direction full-rebrand exploration (`brand-board.html`); prototypes live
> at `kept-preview.html` (mobile) and `kept-desktop.html` (desktop) — dev-only
> render harnesses, never shipped. This document is the single source of truth
> for the public-facing iOS + desktop redesign that replaces Wallaby.

**Why it exists.** Wallaby is a faithful study of loggd.life — close enough
(navy canvas, 5-color accent cycle, GitHub-style contribution grids, 5-tab IA,
the orange/green/yellow/red button stack) that shipping it publicly would read
as a clone. Kept keeps Wallaby's *spirit* — history-first glanceability, warm
dashboard energy, semantic clarity, friendly density — and rebuilds every
expression of it from Boomerang's own metaphor.

**The name.** A boomerang is thrown, it returns, and you *keep* it. The brand
verb set: **throw** (capture a task), **return** (snooze/recur — it comes
back), **catch** (complete), **kept** (your history — everything you caught).

---

## 1 · Identity pillars

1. **Arcs, not grids.** loggd is built on squares (heatmap cells, square
   checkboxes, card grids). Kept is built on circles and arcs: round day-dots,
   circular checks, streak *arcs* that physically bridge consecutive days, a
   semicircular day gauge, arc-tick section markers, the arc-into-catch brand
   mark. The arc is the boomerang's flight path; it appears at every scale.
2. **Night-gum + gold, never navy.** The dark canvas is a deep green-ink
   ("Nightgum"), the light canvas a warm green-tinted paper ("Linen"). The one
   hero color is gold-ochre. No popular productivity app — and certainly not
   loggd — lives in this palette.
3. **One hero color.** Gold carries primary actions, completion, progress, and
   focus. Everything else is hairlines, ink, and per-loop "feather" accents
   used *only* for identity (loop rings, tag dots, trail fills) — never for
   chrome. loggd sprays five equal accents across nav, buttons, and FABs; Kept
   doesn't.
4. **Hairline calm, dashboard warmth.** Structure comes from v2's heritage:
   hairline-separated lists, generous whitespace, heavy display titles. Cards
   are reserved for *modules* (the Day Arc, a loop's trail) — never for plain
   list rows. The serif display face keeps it human rather than dashboard-cold.
5. **Motion is flight.** Throw, return, catch — the signature micro-animations
   no other app has (§8).

---

## 2 · Brand assets

**The mark — "arc into catch."** An ochre arc descends into a dot (the
returning boomerang, caught), above an upturned ink curve (the open hand /
catch). At small sizes it reads as a sunrise-smile — keep that; it's the
friendliest accident in the system.

```svg
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" fill="none">
  <path d="M 22 52 C 30 18, 70 18, 78 52" stroke="#E3A93C" stroke-width="9" stroke-linecap="round"/>
  <circle cx="78" cy="52" r="7.5" fill="#E3A93C"/>
  <path d="M 30 70 C 42 82, 58 82, 70 70" stroke="#EFF3EC" stroke-width="8" stroke-linecap="round" opacity=".85"/>
</svg>
```
(The catch-curve takes the canvas ink color per palette: `#EFF3EC` on Nightgum,
`#1F2A22` on Linen.)

**Wordmark.** `boomerang.` — lowercase, Fraunces 700, with the period in gold.
The period is the caught dot from the mark; it terminates the name the way the
catch terminates the flight.

**App icon.** The mark centered on a Nightgum→deeper-green vertical gradient
(`#15211B → #0E1511`), rounded-square. Favicon/monochrome contexts: mark only,
single color. Splash: mark + wordmark on flat Nightgum/Linen per system mode.

**Asset checklist for implementation:** `Logo.jsx` replacement (mark, themable
via currentColor/tokens), `favicon.svg`, `icon-180/192/512.png`,
`apple-touch-icon.png`, Pushover application icon, README header.

---

## 3 · Color tokens (`--bm-*`)

Two first-class palettes; the app **follows the system setting** by default
(manual override stays in Settings). Both ship fully QA'd — neither is "the
alternate."

| Token | Nightgum (dark) | Linen (light) | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--bm-bg` | `#101713` | `#F7F4EC` | canvas |
| `--bm-card` | `#18211B` | `#FFFFFF` | module cards |
| `--bm-card-2` | `#202B23` | `#EEEADF` | elevated / pressed |
| `--bm-hairline` | `rgba(238,243,236,.09)` | `rgba(31,42,34,.10)` | dividers |
| `--bm-hairline-strong` | `rgba(238,243,236,.17)` | `rgba(31,42,34,.20)` | outlines |
| `--bm-text` | `#EFF3EC` | `#1F2A22` | primary ink |
| `--bm-text-meta` | 56% ink | 58% ink | secondary |
| `--bm-text-faint` | 34% ink | 34% ink | tertiary |
| `--bm-gold` | `#E3A93C` | `#B8841C` | THE accent |
| `--bm-gold-soft` | gold @ 15% | gold @ 13% | tonal fills |
| `--bm-on-gold` | `#2A2106` | `#FFFBEF` | fg on gold fills |
| `--bm-danger` | `#D96C4A` | `#BA4B2C` | destructive (text-level) |
| `--bm-trail-empty` | ink @ 10% | ink @ 11% | unfilled day-dots |
| `--bm-scrim` | `rgba(5,9,7,.6)` | `rgba(31,42,34,.35)` | sheet backdrops |
| `--bm-shadow` / `--bm-shadow-pop` | palette-aware | palette-aware | elevation |

**Feathers** — per-loop/per-tag identity colors, warm-earth family. Assigned by
stable full-list index (the Wallaby `routineColors` rule carries over), user-
overridable per loop:

| Feather | Nightgum | Linen |
|---|---|---|
| Ochre | `#E3A93C` | `#B8841C` |
| Clay | `#D96C4A` | `#C24E2D` |
| Eucalypt | `#62B98B` | `#3D9A6B` |
| Billabong | `#6FA6C9` | `#41799C` |
| Ironbark | `#9D87D6` | `#7E61C7` |
| Heath | `#C77C9E` | `#B25579` |

Energy types map to feathers (desk→Billabong, people→Ironbark,
errand→Eucalypt, creative→Heath, physical→Clay) — retiring the Tailwind hexes
in `store.ENERGY_TYPES` at implementation time.

**Hard rules.** No raw hex in component CSS/JSX — every color goes through a
`--bm-*` token (the lesson from the Wallaby `--wb-on-action` cleanup is a
day-one rule here). Gold fills always pair with `--bm-on-gold` (dark ink on
gold in Nightgum — a deliberately un-loggd move; loggd puts white on
everything). Danger is text/outline-level only; no big red fills.

---

## 4 · Typography & shape

- **Display: Fraunces** (variable; 600–700, optical size on). Screen titles,
  card module titles, hero numerals (Day Arc count, streak numbers), the
  wordmark. The serif warmth is a primary differentiator from every grotesk
  dashboard app.
- **Body: DM Sans** (kept from v2) — rows, buttons, meta, charts.
- Scale: title 26–28 / module title 14.5–15 / row 14.5–15 / meta 12–12.5 /
  micro-label 10.5–11 (700, +0.1em tracking, uppercase).
- **Radii:** 10 (inputs/segments) · 14 (cards) · 22 (sheets) · circles for all
  checks, dots, and the Throw button. **Wing corner** — `22px 14px 14px 14px`
  — is reserved for ONE hero card per screen (Day Arc on Today; the trail card
  on a loop detail). Everything else is symmetric.
- **Hairline lists:** plain rows divided by `--bm-hairline`; cards never wrap
  plain lists. Tags render as **dot + text** (`• finance`), never filled pills.

---

## 5 · Signature data-viz (replaces every contribution grid)

All four live as standalone components (`FlightTrail`, `MonthDots`,
`DensityRibbon`, `DayArc`) shared verbatim between platforms.

1. **Flight Trail** — the default loop history. Rows of 14 round day-dots
   (2 weeks/row, ~10 weeks visible; mini variant = single 14-day row on list
   rows). Filled dots take the loop's feather at intensity-scaled opacity.
   **Consecutive done-days are bridged by a low arc stroke** above the dots —
   streaks are literally drawn as flights. This is the brand visual.
2. **Month Dots** — calendar view: numbered circle cells (outline = empty,
   feather fill = done), weekday-adjacent done-days bridged by the same arcs.
   Month stepper + "N days · %" footer carry over from Wallaby's detail.
3. **Density Ribbon** — the year view: weekly counts as a smooth area curve
   with a feather gradient fade. Replaces the 53-week grid everywhere
   (Flight log year activity, loop year view, analytics 52-week pattern).
4. **Day Arc** — the daily hero: a semicircular gauge sweeping gold from 0 to
   the points goal, hairline ticks at tenths, a gold tip-dot with ink center,
   the count in Fraunces beneath the apex. Sub-line: `N catches · N loops ·
   N pts left`. Tapping/clicking expands the records detail (current
   v2-home-stats behavior folds in here).

Data sources are unchanged: `completed_history`, `/api/analytics/history`,
`computeDailyStats` — Kept is a presentation swap.

---

## 6 · Mobile (iOS) — IA & components

**Bottom nav: 4 tabs + center Throw.** `Today · Loops · [Throw] · Tasks ·
More`. Tabs are ink/meta with gold active state + 4px dot — one accent, no
per-tab colors. **Throw** is a raised 56px gold circle carrying the brand mark:
tap = quick-capture sheet (title + smart date chips), long-press = full add.
Capture is the most important ADHD action; it owns the architectural center.
**Quokka lives in the header** (gold-tinted sparkle button, always one tap from
every screen), not in the nav — its plan-ready badge dots the bell.

- **Today** — header (mark + wordmark · Quokka · bell · avatar) → Day Arc hero
  (wing corner, date + `↻ N-day rally` chip) → **Today** task rows → **Loops**
  rows (feather ring icon · title · cadence/rally meta · mini Flight Trail ·
  feather-ringed catch circle). Stacks fan out exactly as Wallaby Home does.
- **Loops** — Trail/Month/Year via the single segmented style (underline
  indicator, gold); loop cards with full-width viz; detail keeps Wallaby's
  Streak/Best/Total + month calendar structure, restyled (stat row = hairline
  cells, not pill cards).
- **Tasks** — Upcoming/Backlog/Done segments, grouped sections with the
  arc-tick section label, swipe right-to-left = Catch / Delete, row tap = the
  action sheet (grabber, reschedule chips, "Throw it back — returns Mon",
  Edit, Delete).
- **More** — Arcs (projects), Flight log (profile), Analytics, Packages,
  Settings. Same drill-down pattern as Wallaby's More.
- **Editors** — the Wallaby chip editor carries over restyled (chips →
  hairline-outline, expanded pickers use gold-tint selection); "More options"
  full editor likewise. Full-page takeover + back arrow stays.
- **Sheets** — rounded-top 22, grabber, `--bm-scrim` backdrop.

**Checks:** tasks = gold-outline circles (muted hairline when snoozed/low);
loops = feather-outline circles; fills use the ring color with `--bm-on-gold`
ink check (feather fills use dark-ink check `#10241A`). **Snoozed rows** show
the dashed **`↩ returns Sat`** chip — the return is a first-class visual.

## 7 · Desktop — the command center

Not scaled-up mobile: a three-zone native-feeling workspace (prototype:
`kept-desktop.html`).

```
┌ sidebar 224 ┬ work surface (flex) ────────────┬ Today rail 308 ┐

│ Settings    ┴ kbd hint bar ──────────────────────────────────── │
```

- **Sidebar:** gold **"Throw a task ⌘K"** pill at top (the Throw button's
  desktop form); nav items with count badges; a persistent **Quokka card**
  (last exchange preview) above Settings — desktop Quokka opens as a right
  panel, not a modal.
- **Work surface:** view segments **List / Board / Timeline** — the existing
  Kanban survives as the Board mode (columns restyled: hairline lanes, no
  heavy card chrome); List is default. Selected row gets `card-2` fill +
  hairline outline and drives a right-side **detail panel** (the EditTaskModal
  drawer, restyled) that slides over the Today rail.
- **Today rail:** Day Arc card (wing corner), Loops-today checklist, streak-
  at-risk banner. The rail is the mobile Today screen folded into a column —
  same components, same order, which is what keeps the two platforms feeling
  like one product.
- **Keyboard-first:** persistent hint bar (`⌘K` throw · `J/K` move · `X` catch
  · `S` throw back · `E` edit · `Q` quokka · `?` help). Existing
  `useKeyboardShortcuts` maps over with `⌘K` added.

**Cross-platform coherence rules** (the contract that keeps iOS and desktop
"entirely different but coherent"): identical tokens, identical viz components,
identical row anatomy (check · title · meta/return-chip · feather dots),
identical naming and section labels, identical motion vocabulary. What changes
per platform: navigation chrome (bottom tabs + sheets vs sidebar + panels) and
information density — never the language.

---

## 8 · Motion & haptics

Vocabulary (200–300ms, custom spring `cubic-bezier(.3,1.4,.4,1)`-ish; all
gated on `prefers-reduced-motion`):

- **Catch** — check fills, a 2px gold dot arcs ~24px up-and-back into the
  check (the return), row settles 2px. iOS haptic: `.success` notification.
- **Throw back (snooze)** — row slides right with slight upward arc, fades;
  the `↩ returns` chip stamps in. Haptic: `.light` impact.
- **Throw (capture)** — the Throw button's mark rotates ~12° and springs back;
  the new row drops into the list with a soft arc. Haptic: `.medium` impact.
- **Rally tick** — when a catch extends a streak, the newest trail arc draws
  itself left-to-right (~240ms).
- **Day Arc** — sweeps to its value on screen entry (320ms ease-out), then
  only animates deltas.
- Surface transitions: 180ms fade + 8px slide. Sheets: 240ms spring rise.

---

## 9 · Voice & naming (hybrid)

Plain nouns for navigation — metaphor in verbs and moments. Never make the
user decode jargon to find something; let the personality live where it can't
confuse.

| Concept | UI label | Metaphor usage |
|---|---|---|
| Quick add | **Throw** (button) | "Throw a task" placeholder |
| Complete | check action | Toast: **"Caught it."** / "Nice catch — 3 today." |
| Snooze | Throw it back | Chip: **"↩ returns Tue"** |
| Routine | **Loops** (nav) | "loop closed" in recaps |
| Streak | streak | **"↻ N-day rally"** chip |
| Project | **Arcs** (nav) | "a long arc" in empty states |
| Profile/history | **Flight log** | year activity = "your flights" |

("Loops" and "Arcs" are the two metaphor nouns promoted to navigation — both
self-explanatory enough to pass the no-decoding rule; "Habits" and "Projects"
remain as subtitle glosses during transition, e.g. "Arcs · long-term
projects".)

---

## 10 · Accessibility

- Contrast floors: body ink ≥ 7:1 on canvas, meta ≥ 4.5:1, gold-on-canvas ≥
  3:1 for large/bold UI text only — gold never carries small body text;
  `--bm-on-gold` pairs are ≥ 7:1 in both palettes.
- Color is never the only signal: trail dots pair filled/empty shapes, streak
  arcs duplicate the rally number, feather identity pairs with the loop's
  icon, done-states strike through.
- Touch targets ≥ 44pt; the Throw button 56pt. Dynamic-type-friendly: rows
  wrap, viz components scale off a single `--bm-cell` custom prop (Wallaby
  heatmap pattern).
- Full reduced-motion variants (state changes swap instantly, no arcs drawn).

## 11 · Why this is legally & ethically distinct from loggd

| Axis | loggd / Wallaby | Kept |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas | deep navy | green-ink Nightgum / Linen paper |
| Accent model | 5 equal accents on chrome | one gold hero; feathers for identity only |
| History viz | GitHub contribution grid | Flight Trail dots + streak arcs / Density Ribbon |
| Geometry | squares, square cells, pills | circles, arcs, hairlines, dot-tags |
| Buttons | orange/green/yellow/red stack | gold fill · gold tonal · ghost · danger text |
| Fill foregrounds | white on everything | dark ink on gold |
| Nav | 5 flat color-coded tabs | 4 tabs + center Throw; sidebar command center on desktop |
| Type | grotesk throughout | Fraunces serif display + DM Sans |
| Identity moves | — | wing corner, arc-tick labels, `↩ returns` chip, throw/catch motion, `boomerang.` wordmark |

The retained *ideas* — glanceable per-habit history, a daily dashboard, a
range-segmented detail view — are unprotectable genre conventions shared by
every habit tracker; every *expression* of them above is original.

## 12 · Migration plan (Wallaby → Kept)

Same playbook that built Wallaby — parallel theme family, surface by surface,
fully reversible until cutover:

- **K1 — Brand + tokens.** New mark/wordmark/icons; `src/v2/kept/palette.css`
  (`--bm-*`, `kept-dark`/`kept-light` + system-follow); Fraunces in
  `index.html`; theme registration at the three sync points (index.html
  pre-paint, AppV2 mount, Settings picker).
- **K2 — Viz components.** `FlightTrail`, `MonthDots`, `DensityRibbon`,
  `DayArc` (port the prototype generators to React; share with desktop).
- **K3 — Mobile shell.** KeptNav (4+Throw), header, Today (Day Arc + rows +
  loops), quick-capture sheet.
- **K4 — Mobile surfaces.** Loops/detail, Tasks + action sheet, More, Arcs,
  Flight log; editors restyled.
- **K5 — Desktop command center.** Sidebar, work surface (List default, Kanban
  as Board mode), Today rail, detail panel, ⌘K throw.
- **K6 — Shared modals + cutover.** Settings/Analytics/Packages/Quokka in
  Kept; default new installs to system-follow Kept; Wallaby demoted to a
  legacy theme for one release, then removed (its own "didn't stick" teardown,
  already documented in CLAUDE.md, is the template).

Each phase is an independently mergeable PR with screenshot verification in
both palettes (the Local-Verification-Harness runbook applies unchanged).
